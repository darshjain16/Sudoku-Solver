# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle that challenges your logical thinking and problem-solving skills. This is played on a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 subgrids often called boxes or regions. The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, each column and each 3x3 box contains all numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating any number in those areas.
